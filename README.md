# Daily Planner

## Description

Calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.
The assignment provided starter code with HTML and CSS files, but lacked JavaScript functionality. 
The Work Day Scheduler was designed to enable users to conveniently save appointment data throughout a typical work day, with clear styling
differentiating the current time from past and future events.
